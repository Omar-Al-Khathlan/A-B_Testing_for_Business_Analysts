# A_B_Testing_for_Business_Analysts
An A/B Testing Project for the Udacity course "A/B Testing for Business Analysts".

## Matched Pair Design, Picking Control Units
This project is about selecting appropriate control units for a preselected set of treatment units to test the introduction of a new product to stores.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Matched Pair Design/Matched Pair Design, Picking Control Units.ipynb` file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to project directory, then go to the directory `Matched Pair Design/` and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook "Matched Pair Design, Picking Control Units.ipynb"
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook "Matched Pair Design, Picking Control Units.ipynb"
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software in your browser.

### Data
The datasets used for this project can be found by navigating to project directory, then going to the directory `
Matched Pair Design/Data/`.




## Randomized Design Tests
This project is about testing whether the addition of an automated call reception service would result in better customer ratings.
